        <h1>About RIU</h1>
        <p>
        RIU is an inhouse research unit of acem. It mainly focuses on minimizing the gap between industry and academia. Thus, it solves industry problems utilizing acemâ€™s faculties, students and national/international experts.

It plans to bring experts from different fields to work in industry projects. On one hand, students get an opportunity to work on real life problems that train them even before they complete their undergraduate and on other hand, industries get their problems solved from an academic perspective.

To achieve this goal, RIU trains students on both technical and non-technical skills. Since it is project based learning, students learn by doing.

            <h2>3D printing In ACEM</h2>
            <p>
            3D printing is an additive process whereby layers of material are built up to create a 3D part. This is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing processes, where a final design is cut from a larger block of material. As a result, 3D printing creates less material wastage.

With the vision to create a student empowering learning environment, Research and Innovation Unit(RIU),acem has started 3d printing right from April,2021. Visualizing the object in 3d form while learning would be the best thing for the students to capture the concept as well as to enhance their learning capacity. With major advantages of 3d printing like rapid prototyping,cost effective manufacturing process,flexibility, product testing, etc, the technology is rapidly used worldwide and in Nepal as well.
In the journey of 3d printing technology in acem, a couple of students did research on a 3d printing machine and learned to print the object. The printing process takes a little time according to the weight of the material as it is the additive process. They had the trial printing and learned new things in every test. Things that were new to them were asked to the experts. In the meantime, the students printed the Charlotte valve for the Mission Oxygen Team to help fight against the COVID .Multiple 3d printing assignments were done after that. Now, 3d printing in acem is totally run by the students.

            <p>
            The industry and academia working together for common goals have been a widely implemented modality globally however is a rare practice in Nepal. There are several underlying reasons like outdated curriculum, tight schedule, and lack of interest. As an effort to bridge the gap, a collaborative work between acem and Udayapur Cement Industry Limited was carried out. This case study presents the technical possibilities of enhancement and upscaling the production capacity of Udayapur Cement Industry Limited (UCIL). This work also dissects the industry-academia collaboration through the lenses of students, faculty members, researchers, college, and industry experts. 
The team carried out an assessment on Reinforced Suspension Preheater (RSP) to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the plant. The detailed research gave the best suited solution for the cement factory based on the current status of the plant. Along with the technical assessment, the team also proposed an optimum strategy to roll out the plan.
